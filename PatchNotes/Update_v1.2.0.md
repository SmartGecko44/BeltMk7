Satisfactory 1.0 release support. Updated cost and unlock to be in-line with 1.0 balance.




If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## Changed Stuff

- Renamed the mod's belts (and the mod itself) to `Conveyor Belt Mk7*` because Coffee Stain had me well and truly fooled that they would never add another belt tier. All pre-existing belts will be fine and are unaffected by the name change
- Moved the milestone to unlock the belts to Tier 9 and is now priced to be post-Quantum Encoding
- Belt and Lift price updated to be above the cost of the new vanilla Mk6 belts
- Temporarily made the [Counter Limiter mod dependency](https://ficsit.app/mod/CounterLimiter) optional because Digby hasn't updated it for 1.0 yet. I plan to re-add the dependency when it is updated.
